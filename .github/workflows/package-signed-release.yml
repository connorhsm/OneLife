# Purpose
# Once main release workflow is complete, we manually download the Windows package
# and sign the exe which is uploaded individually back to the draft release as '2HOL_Signed.exe'
# This workflow takes the original Windows package and replaces the exe with the signed exe, re-packages and finally uploads back to the release.
